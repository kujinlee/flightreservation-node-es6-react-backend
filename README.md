# Flight Reservation System (Node.js)

This is a Node.js implementation of the Flight Reservation System. It allows users to search for flights, complete reservations, and check-in for flights.

---

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher recommended)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (for database setup)
- [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) (for generating SSL/TLS certificates)

---

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/kujinlee/flightreservation-node-es6-react-backend.git
   cd flightreservation-node-es6-react-backend
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and configure the following variables:

   ```plaintext
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_USER=root
   DB_PASSWORD=<your-password>
   DB_NAME=reservation
   PORT=8080
   EXPOSED_PORT=8082
   DOCKER_ENV=true
   NODE_ENV=development
   HOST_URL=localhost
   USE_HTTPS=true
   BASE_URL=/flightreservation-node-es6-react-backend
   DEBUG=sequelize:*
   ```

   Replace `<your-password>` with your actual MySQL root password.

   - **DB_HOST**: The hostname of your database (e.g., `localhost` or `mysql` if using Docker Compose).
   - **DB_USER**: The username for your database (e.g., `root`).
   - **DB_PASSWORD**: The password for your database user.
   - **DB_NAME**: The name of the database to use (e.g., `reservation`).
   - **PORT**: The internal port the application will run on (default: `8080`).
   - **EXPOSED_PORT**: The port exposed to the host machine (default: `8082`).
   - **DOCKER_ENV**: Set to `true` if running in a Docker environment.
   - **NODE_ENV**: The environment mode (e.g., `development`, `production`).
   - **HOST_URL**: The hostname or IP address of the application (default: `localhost`).
   - **USE_HTTPS**: Set to `true` to enable HTTPS, `false` for HTTP.
   - **BASE_URL**: The base URL path for the application (e.g., `/flightreservation-node-es6-react-backend`).
   - **DEBUG**: Debugging options for Sequelize (e.g., `sequelize:*` for all Sequelize logs).

4. **Generate SSL/TLS Certificates for Development**:
   If `USE_HTTPS=true` is set in the `.env` file, you need to generate self-signed SSL/TLS certificates for development:

   ```sh
   mkdir certs
   openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 \
       -keyout certs/key.pem \
       -out certs/cert.pem \
       -subj "/C=US/ST=State/L=City/O=Organization/OU=Unit/CN=localhost"
   ```

   - This will create two files in the `certs/` directory:
     - `key.pem`: The private key.
     - `cert.pem`: The self-signed certificate.
   - Ensure the `certs/` directory is excluded from the repository (already handled in `.gitignore`).

5. **Start the Application and Database**:
   Use Docker Compose to start both the application and the MySQL database:

   ```sh
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

   - This command will:
     - Start the **MySQL database** on port `3306`.
     - Start the **Node.js application** on port `8082` (mapped to the app's internal port `8080`).

6. **Initialize the Database**:
   Once the MySQL database is running, execute the SQL scripts to set up the schema and seed data:

   ```sh
   docker exec -i <mysql-container-name> mysql -u root -p<your-password> reservation < sql-scripts/1-schema.sql
   docker exec -i <mysql-container-name> mysql -u root -p<your-password> reservation < sql-scripts/2-seed.sql
   ```

   - Replace `<mysql-container-name>` with the name of your MySQL container (e.g., `flightreservation-node-es6_db_1`).
   - The `mysql-data/` directory will be automatically created to persist the database data.

7. **Access the Application**:
   Open your browser and navigate to:
   [https://localhost:8082/flightreservation-node-es6-react-backend/findFlights](https://localhost:8082/flightreservation-node-es6-react-backend/findFlights)

   - This will take you to the first page of the application.
   - Ensure that the `BASE_URL` in your `.env` file is set to `/flightreservation-node-es6-react-backend` for the application to work correctly.

## Environment Variables

The application uses the following environment variables to configure its behavior:

### 1. `DOCKER_ENV`
- **Purpose**: Indicates whether the application is running in a Dockerized environment.
- **Values**:
  - `true`: The application is running inside a Docker container.
  - `false`: The application is running in a non-Dockerized environment.
- **Usage**:
  - When `DOCKER_ENV=true`, the application uses `EXPOSED_PORT` for external access and assumes the database host is defined by `DB_HOST` (e.g., `mysql` in `docker-compose.yml`).
  - When `DOCKER_ENV=false`, the application uses `PORT` for local access and assumes the database host is defined by `DB_HOST` (e.g., `127.0.0.1` or another hostname).

### 2. `DB_HOST`
- **Purpose**: Specifies the hostname or IP address of the database server.
- **Default Value**: `127.0.0.1`
- **Usage**:
  - Can be set to:
    - `127.0.0.1` or `localhost` for local development.
    - An IP address (e.g., `192.168.1.100`) for remote databases.
    - A Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) (e.g., `db.example.com`) for production environments.
  - Example:
    - If `DB_HOST=db.example.com`, the application will connect to the database at `db.example.com`.

### 3. `HOST_URL`
- **Purpose**: Specifies the hostname or IP address of the server hosting the application.
- **Default Value**: `localhost`
- **Usage**:
  - Can be set to:
    - `localhost` for local development.
    - An IP address (e.g., `192.168.1.100`) for remote servers.
    - A Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) (e.g., `app.example.com`) for production environments.
  - Example:
    - If `HOST_URL=app.example.com` and `PORT=8080`, the application will be accessible at `http://app.example.com:8080`.

### 4. `EXPOSED_PORT`
- **Purpose**: Specifies the external port for accessing the application in a Dockerized environment.
- **Default Value**: Same as `PORT`
- **Usage**:
  - When `DOCKER_ENV=true`, the application uses `EXPOSED_PORT` to expose the application to the host machine.
  - Example:
    - If `EXPOSED_PORT=8082`, the application will be accessible at `http://localhost:8082`.

### 5. `PORT`
- **Purpose**: Specifies the internal port the application listens on.
- **Default Value**: `8080`
- **Usage**:
  - Used in both Dockerized and non-Dockerized environments to define the port the application listens on internally.
  - Example:
    - If `PORT=8080`, the application listens on port `8080` inside the container or locally.

---

## Example `.env` File

Below is an example `.env` file for both Dockerized and non-Dockerized environments:

### Non-Dockerized Environment
```plaintext
DOCKER_ENV=false
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=
DB_NAME=reservation
PORT=8080
HOST_URL=localhost
```

### Dockerized Environment
```plaintext
DOCKER_ENV=true
DB_HOST=mysql
DB_PORT=3306
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=yourpassword
DB_NAME=reservation
PORT=8080
EXPOSED_PORT=8082
HOST_URL=localhost
```

---

## How These Variables Work Together

1. **Non-Dockerized Environment**:
   - The application listens on `PORT` (default: `8080`).
   - The database is accessed at `DB_HOST` (e.g., `127.0.0.1`, `localhost`, or another hostname).

2. **Dockerized Environment**:
   - The application listens on `PORT` (default: `8080`) internally but is exposed externally on `EXPOSED_PORT` (default: `8082`).
   - The database is accessed at `DB_HOST` (e.g., `mysql`, the service name in `docker-compose.yml`).

---

## Directory Descriptions

### **`certs/`**

- This directory is used to store SSL/TLS certificates for enabling HTTPS.
- **Important**: Certificates should not be pushed to the repository. They are excluded by the `.gitignore` file.
- If HTTPS is enabled (`USE_HTTPS=true` in `.env`), ensure that valid certificates (`cert.pem` and `key.pem`) are placed in this directory.

### **`mysql-data/`**

- This directory is used to persist MySQL database data when running the database in a Docker container.
- **Important**: This directory should not be pushed to the repository. It is excluded by the `.gitignore` file.
- The data in this directory ensures that the database state is preserved across container restarts.
- It will be automatically created when the SQL scripts are executed.

---

## Notes

- Ensure that the `.env` file is **not pushed to the repository**. It is already excluded by the `.gitignore` file.
- Use a secure password for your database and avoid hardcoding it in the codebase.
